## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and understanding of Requirement Analysis in the context of software development. Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered and documented. Proper requirement analysis ensures that the software being developed meets the desired functionality, performance, and quality standards.

This repository will contain various resources, including methodologies, best practices, case studies, and examples related to requirement analysis. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for developers, project managers, and other stakeholders involved in the requirement gathering and analysis process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It involves identifying functional and non-functional requirements, clarifying business goals, and understanding user needs. This phase is crucial in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) as it ensures that the final product aligns with the intended objectives and minimizes the risk of project failure. Proper requirement analysis helps in setting clear expectations and avoids costly changes later in development.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The process of Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that help ensure the successful identification and documentation of software requirements:

1) Requirement Gathering  
  This is the initial phase where information is collected from various stakeholders, including clients, end-users, business analysts, and subject matter experts. The goal is to gather as much relevant data as possible regarding the desired functionality and constraints of the system.

2) Requirement Elicitation 
  In this phase, more detailed discussions are held with stakeholders to draw out their needs, expectations, and specific requirements. Techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and use cases are employed to identify both functional and non-functional requirements.

3) Requirement Documentation**  
  After gathering and eliciting the requirements, the next step is to document them clearly and systematically. This documentation serves as the foundation for the development process and provides a reference for all project participants.

4) Requirement Analysis and Modeling 
  Once the requirements are documented, they are analyzed for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. During this phase, models such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are created to represent the system’s behavior and structure in a more understandable way.

5) Requirement Validation  
  Requirement validation ensures that the documented requirements align with the stakeholder's needs and expectations. This is done through reviews, walkthroughs, and prototype testing to verify that the requirements are both accurate and achievable within the project constraints.

## Types of Requirements

In a software project, requirements are typically classified into two categories: Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements**. Below, we define each type and provide examples from the context of a Booking Management Project.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the specific behavior or functions of a system. They describe what the system should do, detailing the interactions between the user and the system, and ensuring the system meets the needs of its users.

#### Examples for Booking Management Project:
1) User Account Creation: The system should allow users to create an account by entering basic information such as name, email, and password.
2) Search Availability: The system should enable users to search for available booking slots based on the location, date, and time.

3)Booking Confirmation: After selecting a time slot, users should be able to confirm their booking and receive an email notification with booking details.

4)Payment Integration: The system should allow users to make payments securely via integrated payment gateways like PayPal or credit card.

5)Booking Cancellation: Users should have the ability to cancel their booking, and the system should send a cancellation confirmation email.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the quality attributes or conditions under which the system must operate. They focus on how well the system performs the functions outlined in the functional requirements, including aspects like performance, security, and usability.

#### Examples for Booking Management Project:
1) Performance: The system should be able to handle up to 500 concurrent users without degradation in performance.
2) Availability: The booking platform should be available 99.9% of the time, ensuring minimal downtime for users.
3) Scalability: The system must be designed to scale easily to accommodate increased user traffic during peak booking seasons.
4) Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to complete a booking within three minutes on average.
5)Security: User data, including payment information, should be encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols to protect sensitive information.



## Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and a system. These diagrams help to illustrate the system's functional requirements by showing the actions or use cases that each actor can perform. They provide a high-level view of the system's functionality and are often used in the early stages of software design to ensure that all requirements are captured and understood.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

1) Clear Communication: Use case diagrams help stakeholders (e.g., developers, designers, clients) understand the system’s functionality in a simple, visual manner.
   
2)Requirements Verification: They ensure that all functional requirements are properly captured and are in alignment with user needs.

3)System Design: These diagrams aid in identifying the system's key functions and the relationships between actors, which is essential for designing the system’s architecture.

4)Scope Management: Use case diagrams help define the scope of the system by identifying the specific actions that users can perform, reducing the chance of scope creep.

### Use Case Diagram for the Booking Management System

Below is a use case diagram for a **Booking Management System**. The diagram includes actors (such as the User, Admin, and Payment Gateway) and their corresponding use cases (such as "Search Availability," "Make Booking," "Cancel Booking," etc.).

![Booking System Use Case Diagram]

## Actors:
1) User: An individual who interacts with the system to make or manage bookings.
   
3) Admin: A system administrator who manages users, booking records, and system settings.
   
3)Payment Gateway: A third-party service that handles the payment transactions for bookings.

#### Use Cases:
0) Search Availability: The user can search for available booking slots.
1) Make Booking: The user can book a time slot after confirming availability.
2) Cancel Booking: The user can cancel an existing booking.
3) View Booking History: The user can view past and upcoming bookings.
4) Manage Bookings: Admin can modify or cancel any booking in the system.
5)  Process Payment: The system integrates with the Payment Gateway to process the user's payment for the booking.
6) Send Confirmation Email: The system sends a confirmation email to the user upon successful booking.


cceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature:

The user must be able to view a summary of their booking details (e.g., date, time, service type, total cost) before proceeding to payment.
The system should allow the user to select a payment method from available options (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
Upon successful payment, the user should receive a confirmation message and a booking reference number.
If the payment fails, the user should be presented with a relevant error message and prompted to retry or choose an alternative payment method.
The system must update the booking status to "Confirmed" upon successful payment and store the transaction details.
The checkout process must be completed within 5 minutes to avoid session timeouts.
The system should send an email confirmation to the user with the booking details and payment receipt.
